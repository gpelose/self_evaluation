I am not very flexible and can barely touch my toes due to having weird hip bones, this giff looks like the guy is able to touch his head with his leg and that is how I feel about the result of this course. I came in with essentially no coding experience, I thought I had some but after getting a week into the class I realized that it was very minimal and I felt scared that I couldnt get anywhere in the process, kind of like my tight hamstrings haha. I have completely overcome that fear due to this course and feel like I understand how to code and it is a very satifying feeling, similar to the feeling I would have if I could reach my hamstrings.

##Instructions

***

Please download this Markdown file (`selfevaluation.Rmd`) from my GitHub site (in the `fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/` folder) and answer the appropriate questions in the spaces provided. Once you've knitted the final file, please *email* the **html** version of that file to me with the name `[LastF]_F19_SelfEvaluation.html` (with `LastF` meaning your last name followed by your first initial, i.e., mine would be called `SchmittC_F19_SelfEvaluation.html`). I must receive this file by **Midnight of December 17, 2019**.

###Overall Impression

***

My overall impression of the course was that it was quite challenging but in a good way. I really wanted to step out of my box this semester and try some new types of classes and this was one of them, I found to truly enjoy the result. My highlight was realizing that I can now make what ever graph that I want!

###What did you accomplish?

***

<br><br><br><br>

I accomplished all of the tasts that you assigned. I unfortunatley handed in the second homework assingments quite late but we had discussed this in person due to Clint and I having one of our coaches pass away. Thank you so much for being so understnading about that. 

***

###How well did you accomplish them?

***

<br><br><br><br>

I feel that I accomplished them to the best of my ability. I definitely struggled with parts of different homework assignments and looking back through the assingments just now I realized how much time I put into each of these assingments. I also realized that I could fix some of the problems that took me a very long time to figure out back then in seconds now so I think that is very good thing. I feel I did best in really focusing and getting past the hump of learning how to code in the beginning. I thenfound myself getting stuck on small things and getting past those was what I did least well in. The hardest part for me was trying to create the function. As stated earlier my ease and understanding most definitely improved throughout the course.

###How has your understanding of and approach to statistics and project design changed since taking this course?

***

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

1000000% better, I did not really have an amazing approach to statistics and or project design at all in the beginning. I took stats mt freshman year and refreshed myself on some of the subject before we started this class but I learned a lot about statistics and am very happy with how much I learned about project design as well. 


***

###What did you learn from all this?

***

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

I learned to not be as scared in the beginning to get into something. I felt a huge road block in from of me when I first started coding in this course. I found the simpliest things to be so comfusing, I now feel that I have a solid understanding of how to use R. I also learned how to use github. Finally I learned how to run many types of statistics in R as well. I am excited to try and use these in my own future research.

###How did the Peer Commentary process and Group Project relate, if at all, to what you view as your successes or difficulties in this course?

***
The peer commentary was very helpful at times and helped towards my success as I was able to try my best to help others and get help from them as well. 
The group project was amazing, I learned so much from lara and brenna. I was lucky to be partners with them becasue they were a lot of fun to work with and taught me a lot as well. So I would say that both the peer commentary and group project were a huge success for me.

###What, if anything, of lasting value do you take away from this experience? If nothing, what would you do differently if you were to start over in this course? 

***
The main thing that I would have done differently is chill out at the beginning of the course because I was very nervouse that I was not going to get past the hump of learning how to code and here I am now!!!!! 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

###Taking this self-assessment into account (and with **A** being the highest), if you were the instructor, what grade would you give yourself given your evaluation of your own performance this semester? Please be honest.

***

I would give myself an A, I felt that I have learned a huge amount from this course considering I started essentailly from scratch. I also worked really hard to get here as well.
